# zig-waybar-contrib
A collection of high-performance Waybar modules written in Zig.

## Overview
`zig-waybar-contrib` provides efficient and lightweight modules for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) by leveraging the performance and safety features of [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). These modules are designed to optimize system monitoring and status reporting with minimal resource usage.

## Features
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Optimized Zig implementations for minimal resource consumption.
- üß© **Modular Design**: Select only the modules you need for flexibility.
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Accurate system metrics with minimal overhead.
  
## Available Modules
- All modules write a single line json output.
- All modules are compiled with LTO and ReleaseFast optimizations. See the [build](./build.zig) file for details.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/erffy/zig-waybar-contrib/releases).
2. Alternatively, you can build from source (see the section below).

## Configuration

Add modules to your Waybar configuration (`~/.config/waybar/config`):

```json
{
    "modules-right": [
        "custom/updates",
        "custom/gpu",
        "custom/memory",
        "custom/ping"
    ],
    "custom/updates": {
        "exec": "path/to/updates-module",
        "return-type": "json",
        "interval": 3600
    }
    // Add other module configurations as needed
}
```

## Building from Source
